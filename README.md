# Beir Bua Bakes
 Beir Bua Bakes is a website for a Baker in Co. Louth, that creates fresh, exciting and delicious bakes for all. 

The site consists of three pages, the 'Home' page, the 'Our Bakes' page and the 'Contact Us' page. The Website is very easy to navigate and use.

## Inception and Initial Design

I had a rough idea in my head of how I wanted to the website to look like, after a project inception meeting with my mentor, he recommended that I use 'Balsamiq' to draft out some rough mock-up wireframes of how I wanted to design the website. These were the designs, which I believe match the finished project.

## Features

* Navigation and Ease of Access

### Hamburger Menu
* I placed a dropdown hamburger menu at the top-right corner of the website. 
* The menu navigates the user through to the 'Home,' 'Our Bakes,' and "Contact Us' pages. 
* The menu sections are decorated with icons from [fontawesome.com](https://fontawesome.com/icons).

### Header 

* The header features the Bakery's logo, along with their tagline 'The Artisan Way, Since 2021.'
* The tagline and other headings on the site are styled with the 'Courier-New" font family. It is a rustic font that suits the aesthetic of the site and business. 
* The header also features a Hero image, which is a stock image from [pexels.com](https://www.pexels.com/), that suits the colour scheme of the website.

### About Us Section 

The 'About Us' section is centered under the Hero Image on the 'Home' page. It gives a brief bit of information on the business and the services that they offer. The 'About Us' section, sits on a styled box div, that's design is based off the company's logo and its colour scheme.

### Our Bakes 

* The second page of the webiste features six of the most popular bakes by the Bakery. 
* Each bakes are aligned in opposite directions, per-row, along with a short descriptive paragraph in their box divs.
* The designed box divs are based off the company logo, with the RGB charcoal and orange colors, taken from the logo, using an eyedropper tool.

## Colour Scheme and Design 

The colour scheme of the website, was based off the colours that feature in the company's logo. Using [imagecolorpicker.com](https://imagecolorpicker.com), I was able to isolate and identify the RGB values for the different colours that I wanted to use for the website. See the RBG colour palette, below the company logo, created using [coolors.com](https://coolors.com).
